# AjCoRe

A simple Content Repository, written in C#. Still under development

## Notes

A Content Repository has Workspaces.

Each Workspace has a Root Node.

A Node has Properties.

A Node could have ChildNodes.

Currently, there is a Base implementation (Nodes in memory), and a read-only Filesystem implementation
(Nodes are files and directories)
